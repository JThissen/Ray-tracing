# Ray tracing in C++

This project served as an introduction to ray tracing.

The code supports Phong diffusion, reflection, refraction, point lights, soft shadows and anti-aliasing. Currently, only spheres can be rendered. Polygon meshes based on triangles will be added at some point in the near future.
